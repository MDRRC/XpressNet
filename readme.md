Xpressnet 
=====================

This code is modified code from http://pgahtow.de/wiki/index.php?title=Hauptseite for use on a STM32 Maple Mini.

The Stm32 sources for Arduino from https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32 need also an update,
Replace the files usart.c and usart_private.h in the stm32f1 directory. 

@ Copyright notice, files are changed by me to get XpressNet working on the STM32f1 series but all credits to the creators of XpressNet and Stm32 files for Arduino!
